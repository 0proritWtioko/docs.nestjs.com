# Lego Star Wars Complete Saga Empire Strikes Back Walkthrough
  
I have every blue mini kit, all gold blocks all characters, and built that gold thing outside that shoots out all the lego studes. all superstories have been completed because they all have the gold block above them and when i enter they say replay story, or free play, execpt for the racing ones. i am beyond frustrated because i have no idea what to do, i have just tried simple things like replaying a story mode, but nothing happens. i have checked that i have bought everything...anyone have the problem with 99.6%???
 
yes i have searched the forums and came across people saying they hadn't done super stories but had all the achievements, which i don't see because you can't have all the bricks unless you do the super stories. but anyways i have done the super stories, there is a brick spinning above the name of the story before i go in, all bricks gold, red, mini kits, blue mini kits, bounty hunter missions, characters are unlocked. the only achievement i am missing is the 100% one.

You have to be missing one of the Super Stories. Go into the ? bonus room in each section and highlight "Super Story". It will then show your time of how fast you did it in. If it still shows exactly 1 hour as the time and a high score of exactly 100,000 then you did not complete that Super Story. Hope that helps.
 
unfortunately it DOES NOT show you what your best time is in the Super Stories. So you have to go thru all of them and hope you aren't replaying any again. As if playing the whole game 3 times wasn't enough. But I like this game a lot so I don't mind playin another go.
 
auctully it does show your best time for the Super Storys. I have been able to see that. Did you make sure you finished the entire story with less than one hour and above the coin count? Because ive finished when ive got about the coin count but it didnt regonize that i did it.
 
While you may have already done this I'll mention it just in case. Did you create the two custom characters in the Cantina and save them? I believe that adds to your overall completion percentage, but I can't remember.
 
you do not have to beat the super stories in under an hour. you also do not get any bricks in the super stories so make sure you have played through all the super stories. or even play them again to be sure

Check your super story times and see if you beat them in under an hour and collected 100,000 studs in them. Then check you have bought all of the hints and red power bricks, its likely you missed some of these.
 
i went back and checked and found out that i had not done the empire strikes back super story for some reason, but i had done all the other ones, don't know how i slipped past that, but anyways even though it says 2/2, which i was taken for granted meant i had done them, you need to walk in there and see if it reads exactly one hour, or 100,000 studs, if it does you didn't do it. and i guess each one is only worth .3 percent since that is all i did to get 100% when i was at 99.6%.
 
also i came across the same problem many others were having after they got 100% displayed but no achievement. it was a easy fix so don't freak out, if you are displaying 100% just do what the others in different post suggested, and that was walk into the first episode and do the first chapter, get a few studs, exit out so you can exit and save, and up popped the achievement.
 
Although I have Episodes 2-6 to do yet for Super Story runs. Right now, after doing Episode 1 Super Story, I have 98.2%. Ive read in other posts that you get .3% for the super stories, and .1% once you complete them all.
