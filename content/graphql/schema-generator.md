### Generating SDL

> warning **Warning** This chapter applies only to the code first approach.

To manually generate a GraphQL SDL schema (i.e., without running an application, connecting to the database, hooking up resolvers, etc.), use the `GraphQLSchemaBuilderModule`.

```typescript
async function generateSchema() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(GraphQLSchemaBuilderModule);
  await app.init();

  const gqlSchemaFactory = app.get(GraphQLSchemaFactory);
  const schema = await gqlSchemaFactory.create([RecipesResolver]);
  console.log(printSchema(schema));
}
```

> info **Hint** The `GraphQLSchemaBuilderModule` and `GraphQLSchemaFactory` are imported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package. The `printSchema` function is imported from the `graphql` package.

The `gqlSchemaFactory.create()` method takes an array of resolver class references. For example:

```typescript
const schema = await gqlSchemaFactory.create([
  RecipesResolver,
  AuthorsResolver,
  PostsResolvers,
]);
```

It also allows several options:

```typescript
const schema = await gqlSchemaFactory.create([RecipesResolver], {
  skipCheck: true,
  orphanedTypes: [],
});
```
