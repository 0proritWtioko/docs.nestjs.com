### Validation

It is best practice to validate the correctness of any data sent into a web application. To automatically validate incoming requests, Nest provides several pipes available right out-of-the-box:

- `ValidationPipe`
- `ParseIntPipe`
- `ParseBoolPipe`
- `ParseArrayPipe`
- `ParseUUIDPipe`

The `ValidationPipe` makes use of the powerful [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator) package and its declarative validation decorators. The `ValidationPipe` provides a convenient approach to enforce validation rules for all incoming client payloads, where the specific rules are declared with simple annotations in local class/DTO declarations in each module.

#### Overview

In the [Pipes](/pipes) chapter, we went through the process of building simple pipes to demonstrate how the process works. Be sure to review that chapter to best understand the topics of this chapter. Here, we'll focus on various **real world** use cases of the `ValidationPipe`, and show how to use some of its advanced customization features.

#### Auto-validation

We'll start by binding `ValidationPipe` at the application level, thus ensuring all endpoints are protected from receiving incorrect data.

```typescript
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule);
  app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe());
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

To test our pipe, let's create a basic endpoint.

```typescript
@Post()
create(@Body() createUserDto: CreateUserDto) {
  return 'This action adds a new user';
}
```

> info **Hint** Since TypeScript does not store metadata about **generics or interfaces**, when you use them in your DTOs, `ValidationPipe` may not be able to properly validate incoming data.

Now we can add a few validation rules in our `CreateUserDto`. We do this using decorators provided by the `class-validator` package, described in detail [here](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator#validation-decorators). In this fashion, any route that uses the `CreateUserDto` will automatically enforce these validation rules.

```typescript
import { IsEmail, IsNotEmpty } from 'class-validator';

export class CreateUserDto {
  @IsEmail()
  email: string;

  @IsNotEmpty()
  password: string;
}
```

With these rules in place, if a request hits our endpoint with an invalid `email` property in the request body, the application will automatically respond with a `400 Bad Request` code, along with the following response body:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": ["email must be an email"]
}
```

In addition to validating request bodies, the `ValidationPipe` can be used with other request object properties as well. Imagine that we would like to accept `:id` in the endpoint path. To ensure that only numbers are accepted for this request parameter, we can use the following construct:

```typescript
@Get(':id')
findOne(@Param() params: FindOneParams) {
  return 'This action returns a user';
}
```

`FindOneParams`, like a DTO, is simply a class that defines validation rules using `class-validator`. It would look like this:

```typescript
import { IsNumberString } from 'class-validator';

export class FindOneParams {
  @IsNumberString()
  id: number;
}
```

#### Disable detailed errors

Error messages can be helpful to explain what was incorrect in a request. However, some production environments prefer to disable detailed errors. Do this by passing an options object to the `ValidationPipe`:

```typescript
app.useGlobalPipes(
  new ValidationPipe({
    disableErrorMessages: true,
  }),
);
```

As a result, detailed error messages won't be displayed in the response body.

#### Stripping properties

Our `ValidationPipe` can also filter out properties that should not be received by the method handler. In this case, we can **whitelist** the acceptable properties, and any property not included in the whitelist is automatically stripped from the resulting object. For example, if our handler expects `email` and `password` properties, but a request also includes an `age` property, this property can be automatically removed from the resulting DTO. To enable such behavior, set `whitelist` to `true`.

```typescript
app.useGlobalPipes(
  new ValidationPipe({
    whitelist: true,
  }),
);
```

When set to true, this will automatically remove non-whitelisted properties (those without any decorator in the validation class).

Alternatively, you can stop the request from processing when non-whitelisted properties are present, and return an error response to the user. To enable this, set the `forbidNonWhitelisted` option property to `true`, in combination with setting `whitelist` to `true`.

#### Transform payload objects

Payloads coming in over the network are plain JavaScript objects. The `ValidationPipe` can automatically transform payloads to be objects typed according to their DTO classes. To enable auto-transformation, set `transform` to `true`.

```typescript
app.useGlobalPipes(
  new ValidationPipe({
    transform: true,
  }),
);
```

With the auto-transformation option enabled, the `ValidationPipe` will also perform conversion of primitive types. In the following example, the `findOne()` method takes one argument which represents an extracted `id` path parameter:

```typescript
@Get(':id')
findOne(@Param('id') id: number) {
  console.log(typeof id === 'number'); // true
  return 'This action returns a user';
}
```

By default, every path parameter and query parameter comes over the network as a `string`. In the above example, we specified the `id` type as a `number` (in the method signature). Therefore, the `ValidationPipe` will try to automatically convert a string identifier to a number.

#### Explicit conversion

In the above section, we showed how the `ValidationPipe` can implicitly transform query and path parameters based on the expected type. However, this feature requires having auto-transformation enabled.

Alternatively (with auto-transformation disabled), you can explicitly cast values using the `ParseIntPipe` or `ParseBoolPipe` (note that `ParseStringPipe` is not needed because, as mentioned earlier, every path parameter and query parameter comes over the network as a `string` by default).

```typescript
@Get(':id')
findOne(
  @Param('id', ParseIntPipe) id: number,
  @Query('sort', ParseBoolPipe) sort: boolean,
) {
  console.log(typeof id === 'number'); // true
  console.log(typeof sort === 'boolean'); // true
  return 'This action returns a user';
}
```

> info **Hint** The `ParseIntPipe` and `ParseBoolPipe` are exported from the `@nestjs/common` package.

#### Parsing and validating arrays

TypeScript does not store metadata about generics or interfaces, so when you use them in your DTOs, `ValidationPipe` may not be able to properly validate incoming data. For instance, in the following code, `createUserDtos` won't be correctly validated:

```typescript
@Post()
createBulk(@Body() createUserDtos: CreateUserDto[]) {
  return 'This action adds new users';
}
```

To validate the array, create a dedicated class which contains a property that wraps the array, or use the `ParseArrayPipe`.

```typescript
@Post()
createBulk(
  @Body(new ParseArrayPipe({ items: CreateUserDto }))
  createUserDtos: CreateUserDto[],
) {
  return 'This action adds new users';
}
```

In addition, the `ParseArrayPipe` may come in handy when parsing query parameters. Let's consider a `findByIds()` method that returns users based on identifiers passed as query parameters.

```typescript
@Get()
findByIds(
  @Query('id', new ParseArrayPipe({ items: Number, separator: ',' }))
  ids: number[],
) {
  return 'This action returns users by ids';
}
```

This construction validates the incoming query parameters from an HTTP `GET` request like the following:

```bash
GET /?ids=1,2,3
```

#### WebSockets and Microservices

While this chapter shows examples using HTTP style applications (e.g., Express or Fastify), the `ValidationPipe` works the same for WebSockets and microservices, regardless of the transport method that is used.
