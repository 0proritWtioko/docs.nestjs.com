### Hybrid application

A hybrid application is one that both listens for HTTP requests, as well as makes use of connected microservices. The `INestApplication` instance can be connected with `INestMicroservice` instances through the `connectMicroservice()` method. To connect multiple microservice instances, simply pass additional microservice configuration objects as arguments in a comma-separated list.

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
const microservice = app.connectMicroservice({
  transport: Transport.TCP,
});

await app.startAllMicroservicesAsync();
await app.listen(3001);
```

#### Sharing configuration
By default a hybrid application will not inherit global pipes, interceptors, guards and filters configured for the main (HTTP-based) application.
To inherit these configuration properties from the main application, set the `inheritAppConfig` property in the second argument (an optional options object) of the `connectMicroservice()` call, as follow:

```typescript
const microservice = app.connectMicroservice({
  transport: Transport.TCP
}, { inheritAppConfig: true });
```
