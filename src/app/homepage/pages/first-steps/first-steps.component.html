   <h3>First Steps</h3>
   <p>
      In this set of articles you'll learn the <strong>core fundamentals</strong> of Nest. 
      The main idea is to get familiar with essential Nest application building blocks.
      You'll build a basic CRUD application which features covers a lot of ground at an introductory level.

   <h3>Setup</h3>
   <p>
      Setting up a new project is quite simple with <a href="https://github.com/kamilmysliwiec/nest-typescript-starter" target="blank">Starter repository</a>. 
      Just make sure that you have <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="blank">npm</a> installed then use following commands in your OS terminal:
  </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
$ git clone https://github.com/kamilmysliwiec/nest-typescript-starter.git project
$ cd project
$ npm install
$ npm run start</code></pre>
  <p>The <code>project</code> directory will contain several core files inside <code>src</code> directory.
  Following the convention, newly created modules should be placed inside <code>modules</code> directory.
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><code>server.ts</code></td>
      <td>The entry file of the application. It uses <code>NestFactory</code> to create the Nest application instance.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>modules/app.module.ts</code></td>
      <td>Defines <code>AppModule</code>, the root module of the application. Right now it doesn't declare any metadata, because we didn't create any component and controller yet.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    The <code>server.ts</code> contains single async function, which responsibility is to <strong>bootstrap</strong> our application:
  </p>
  <span class="filename">server.ts</span>
  <pre><code class="language-typescript">{{ bootstrap }}</code></pre>
  <p>
    We should always create the Nest application instance using the <code>NestFactory</code>. 
    The <code>create()</code> method returns object, which fulfils <code>INestApplication</code> interface, and provides a set of usable methods, which are well described in the next articles.
